# Schedule automations

You can schedule when the robot should be active.
The `Schedule` module comes with its own UI to manipulate the half-hourly time plan.

```python
{! examples/schedule/main.py !}
```

There is also the possibility to pass a geographic location to restrict the activity to daylight only.
